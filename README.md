# Saving-Application
An application that has been created as a project for a subject in college.
## Introduction:
The idea behind this project is to develope an application that will till you how 
many months you need to save a specific amount of money. For that reason
you have to fill a form which will ask you about your goal, your total income,
your saving amount and the percentage of saving in each month. Then it will 
perform a simple calculation in the backscene finally it will till you how much 
month and Saving/Month you need to achieve your goal.
## GUI:
For the GUI I used customTkinter library, I tried to use various type of inputdata 
element to gain more knowledge and experience and I used grid() function to 
arrange the element.
## DB:
I created my DB in PhpMyadmin ,it has two table ,goal and achievement, the 
first table to store the form values and the seconed is to keep track of the left 
amount and month. I connected to my DB using pymysql.
## Sound:
I used pygame to play sound when user save amount of money each month
and sound when user achieved their goal.
